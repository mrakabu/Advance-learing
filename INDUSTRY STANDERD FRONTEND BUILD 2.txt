✅ Frontend System Design (What you must master)
1) Component Architecture (Clean & scalable UI)
✅ Rule: Components should be boring + reusable

Use 3 layers:

1️⃣ UI components (dumb)

Button, Input, Modal, Card
No API calls, no business logic

2️⃣ Feature components

LoginForm, ResumeUpload, NewsList
Contains validation + small logic

3️⃣ Page/Route components

/login, /dashboard
Connects everything

📌 Folder structure (industry standard)

src/
  app/ (Next.js routes)
  features/
    auth/
    resume/
    tech-news/
  components/ui/
  lib/
  hooks/
  store/

2) State Management Strategies (don’t overuse global state)
✅ What goes where:

✅ React local state (useState)

input fields, toggles, modals

✅ TanStack Query

server data (API fetch, caching, loading, retry)

✅ Zustand

global UI state / auth token / theme / sidebar open/close

🔥 Senior rule:

“Server state ≠ Client state”

Most people mess this up.

3) Rendering Patterns (Next.js App Router)

This is the real upgrade.

✅ Rendering types (simple meaning)

SSR: render on server every request (fresh data)

SSG: generate once at build time (fastest)

ISR: regenerate in intervals (best for news/blog)

CSR: render in browser (good for dashboards)

📌 Best approach today:
✅ Hybrid (mix all)

Example:

Landing page → SSG/ISR

Dashboard → CSR + TanStack Query

Profile page → SSR

4) Server Components (Next.js power)

In App Router:

✅ Default is Server Component

runs on server

good for fetching securely

reduces bundle size

✅ Use "use client" only when needed:

useState

useEffect

onClick

browser APIs

🔥 Best practice:

Keep pages server by default, push interactivity to small client components.

5) Streaming + Suspense (premium UX)

Instead of waiting for everything, stream parts.

Example idea:

Show layout instantly

Show loader for feed

Stream results as they come

This is how modern apps feel “fast”.

6) Edge Rendering

Used when:
✅ you want low-latency globally
Like:

auth checks

redirects

lightweight personalization

Don’t force it everywhere.

7) Frontend Performance (important)
✅ What makes frontend fast:

smaller JS bundle

lazy loading

image optimization

caching server calls

avoid rerenders

debounce inputs

Tools you should use:

Next Image

dynamic import()

React.memo (only when needed)

Lighthouse

✅ Your Stack (Final Setup)

For your level, this is perfect:

✅ Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
✅ TailwindCSS
✅ TanStack Query
✅ Zustand (only if needed)
✅ Zod (validation)
✅ React Hook Form (forms)
