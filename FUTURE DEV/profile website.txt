✅ 1) Frontend (Main Website)
Next.js 15 (React)

Why:

Best for SEO (Google indexing)

Best for routing like /team, /abu, /projects

Fast performance with Server Components

Easy deployment on Vercel

✅ Use App Router (latest standard)

✅ 2) Styling (Premium UI)
Tailwind CSS

Why:

Clean modern UI super fast to build

Easy responsive design

Perfect for Apple-like minimal layouts

shadcn/ui

Why:

Premium ready components (buttons, cards, dialogs)

Looks modern and not “bootstrap-ish”

Customizable + production standard

✅ 3) Animations (Apple Feel)
Framer Motion

Why:

Smooth Apple-style page animations

Section reveal animations

Hover effects (card lift, button glow, etc.)

Works perfectly with Next.js

✅ We’ll keep animations minimal + smooth (premium vibe)

✅ 4) 3D / Depth Feel (Lightweight)

Since you want “not 2D” but also Apple premium:

Option 1 (Recommended): CSS 3D + Tilt

Card tilt on hover

Parallax depth

Shadow + blur layers
✅ Looks 3D but ultra fast

Option 2 (Optional, later): Spline

Add 1 premium 3D object in hero (lightweight)
✅ best “3D look” without heavy coding
❌ but only if it doesn’t slow the site

⚠️ Full Three.js is powerful but can make site heavy if not optimized.

✅ 5) Data Handling (Team Members + Projects)
Simple way (Best for now):

JSON / JS object inside project
Example: data/team.ts, data/projects.ts

✅ easiest
✅ fastest
✅ no backend required
✅ perfect for static portfolio

Advanced way (Later, when bigger):

MongoDB / PostgreSQL + Admin Dashboard

For adding members/projects without code

✅ 6) Contact Form (Must-have)
Option A (Simple & Best):

Formspree / Web3Forms
✅ no backend needed
✅ works instantly
✅ reliable

Option B (Professional full control):

Next.js API Route + Nodemailer
✅ mails go directly from your server
✅ more customizable
❌ needs email setup

✅ 7) Authentication (Only if needed)

Not required for public portfolio.

If later you want admin panel:

NextAuth.js

Google login for admin

✅ 8) Hosting / Deployment
Vercel (Best for Next.js)

One click deploy

Auto builds from GitHub

Free SSL

Fast global CDN

✅ 9) Domain + Branding

Buy domain: name.com / name.dev

Connect to Vercel easily

Recommended:
✅ .dev (developer vibe)
✅ .com (professional clients)

✅ 10) Extra “Premium Add-ons” (Optional)

These make it feel like an Apple product:

✅ next/font (Premium fonts like Inter / SF style)
✅ SEO setup (metadata + OpenGraph for LinkedIn preview)
✅ Dark/Light mode toggle
✅ Smooth scrolling
✅ Performance optimization (lazy loading images)
